# 💈 Barbershop Landing Page

A clean and responsive one-page website for a local barbershop. Built to showcase the business, highlight services, and provide an easy contact point for clients.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- VueJS
- Tailwind

## 📸 Features
- Hero
- Services
- Testimonials
- Contact form

## 🚀 Setup
Clone the repo, npm install and npm run dev – that’s it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TomasJunor/barbershop-landing-page.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your WhatsApp number so bookings open the WhatsApp app directly:

```
VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=54911XXXXXXX
```

Use the international format without `+` or spaces. All booking CTAs reuse this number so you only manage it in one place.
